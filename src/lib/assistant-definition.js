		Here's what relevant values mean:
		- lat: The latitude of the location
		- lon: The longitude of the location
		- Latitude_rescale: The rescaled latitude value
		- Elevation_rescale: The rescaled elevation value
		- Distance_coast_rescale: The rescaled distance to the coast value
		- local_0-2km_start: The amount an area is covered by forest within the 0-2km range at the start of the study
		- regional_2-5km_start: The amount an area is covered by forest within the 2-5km range at the start of the study
		- regional_5-10km_start: The amount an area is covered by forest within the 5-10km range at the start of the study
		- regional_10-25km_start: The amount an area is covered by forest within the 10-25km range at the start of the study
		- regional_25-50km_start: The amount an area is covered by forest within the 25-50km range at the start of the study
		- regional_50-100km_start: The amount an area is covered by forest within the 50-100km range at the start of the study
		- local_0-2km_end: The amount an area is covered by forest within the 0-2km range at the end of the study
		- regional_2-5km_end: The amount an area is covered by forest within the 2-5km range at the end of the study
		- regional_5-10km_end: The amount an area is covered by forest within the 5-10km range at the end of the study
		- regional_10-25km_end: The amount an area is covered by forest within the 10-25km range at the end of the study
		- regional_25-50km_end: The amount an area is covered by forest within the 25-50km range at the end of the study
		- regional_50-100km_end: The amount an area is covered by forest within the 50-100km range at the end of the study
		- Delta_T: The change temperature at that latitude and longitude over the course of the study
		- regional_2-10km_start: The amount an area is covered by forest within the 2-10km range at the start of the study
		- regional_2-10km_end: The amount an area is covered by forest within the 2-10km range at the end of the study
		- regional_10-100km_start: The amount an area is covered by forest within the 10-100km range at the start of the study
		- regional_10-100km_end: The amount an area is covered by forest within the 10-100km range at the end of the study
		- train_test_split: Whether the data point is in the training or testing set

		PAY MOST ATTENTION TO: Delta_T value and differences in Forest coverage.

		Use the papers you have access to to explain the implications of these values and how they relate to the research that has been done. 
		
		Call out Delta_T value and reference as change in temperature. 
		TRY TO USE THE DATA TO COORELATE WITH HEALTH IMPACTS WHEN POSSIBLE.
